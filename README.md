**A Parser for Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar**

Converts a .txt representation (sample input see test.txt) to a CFG (context-free grammar) instance. Such an instance can be used as an input for the inside (O(n^3)) and outside (O(n^3)) algorithms. 

The inside and outside algorithms output a 3D array of floats. See sample output files alpha.txt and beta.txt in src/parser.
